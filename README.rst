============================

This contains everything needed to build the website running at
http://www.studyforrest.org

The site is generated with Pelican and is built primarily using Bootstrap,
jQuery, Tipue Search, and FontAwesome.

Some pages, to provide a more rich experience, use additional frameworks such
as D3.js, dygraphs, xtk.js, and Papaya.

Additional data files are needed for the demo pages --- and Dipy, FSL, and
Nibabel are needed to process them. See ``make data``.
