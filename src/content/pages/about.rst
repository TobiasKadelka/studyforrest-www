This project is an open invitation to anyone and everyone to participate in a
decentralized effort to explore the opportunities of open science in
neuroimaging. We aim to document how much (scientific) value can be generated
from a data release |---| from the publication of scientific findings derived
from this dataset, algorithms and methods evaluated on this dataset, and/or
extensions of this dataset by acquisition and incorporation of new data.

For questions and inquiries, please email us at `info@studyforrest.org
<mailto:info@studyforrest.org?subject=studyforrest.org>`_.

This website is maintained by the `Psychoinformatics Lab
<http://www.ipsy.ovgu.de/ipsy/en/psychoinformatics.html>`_ at the
Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany.

================

This project has been made possible by funds and support of various grants
and institutions.

A grant from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) funded
the initial data acquisition as part of the US-German collaboration in
computational neuroscience (CRCNS) project: *Development of general
high-dimensional models of neuronal representation spaces* (`Haxby
<http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/>`_ / `Ramagde
<http://www.ee.princeton.edu/ramadge/doku.php>`_ / `Hanke
<http://www.psychoinformatics.de/>`_), co-funded by the BMBF and the US National
Science Foundation (BMBF 01GQ1112; NSF 1129855).

Moreover, development of data sharing technology used for dissemination and
management of this dataset is supported by another US-German collaboration grant
awarded to `Halchenko <http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/ppl/yarik.html>`_ and
Hanke: *DataLad: Converging catalogues, warehouses, and deployment logistics
into a federated 'datadistribution'*, also co-funded by BMBF (01GQ1411) and NSF
(1129855).

The German federal state of Saxony-Anhalt, Project: `Center for Behavioral Brain
Sciences`_ provided data acquisition hardware and
personnel.

The Otto-von-Guericke-University_, Magdeburg, Germany.

The `Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology`_ and the `Combinatorial NeuroImaging
Core Facility`_ in Magdeburg, Germany provided MR imaging expertise and access
to its data acquisition instruments.
