Over the past months, we hosted the `real-life cognition challenge
<{filename}/pages/challenge.rst>`_. The goal of this challenge was to engage
the community in studying the brain's behavior in situations with
near-real-life complexity.  The `Center for Behavioral Brain Sciences (CBBS)
Magdeburg <http://www.cbbs.eu>`_ kindly sponsored 5000 Euro to be awarded for
the best contributions.  From May 27 2014, the day our first data release was
published in `Scientific Data <{filename}/Studies/7tad_data.rst>`_, anyone
could submit their contributions. Submissions had to work with, or contribute,
data from complex quasi-natural stimulation, and, in the spirit of open
science, any submission had to include all materials necessary to reproduce the
results and license them in a way that enables derivative works.

Submission to the challenge finally closed on Nov 1 2014. Following the
deadline a jury comprising of Uri Hasson (Princeton University), James Haxby
(Dartmouth College), Daniel Margulies (MPI Leipzig), Russ Poldrack (Stanford),
Jean-Baptiste Poline (Neurospin), Stefan Pollmann (CBBS, Magdeburg), and Peter
Ramadge (Princeton University) evaluated all submissions in terms of novelty of
the approach, scientific rigor, and potential impact on future research and
application.

Each jury member submitted a vote that named a candidate for first, second,
and third place. Votes were then combined into a joint jury decision using
`Condorcet ranking <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method>`_.

The results show a clear picture regarding the winner of the first prize, while
the submissions ranked second and third were only separated by a very narrow
margin.

And without further ado, here they are (imaginative drum roll)...

The winners
===========

First prize (3000 Euro award):
  Juha Pajula, Jussi Tohka, and Jukka-Pekka Kauppi for their `functional brain
  segmentation based on inter-subject correlation
  <{filename}/Studies/contest_fuseisc.rst>`_

Second prize (1500 Euro award):
  Nikolaas N. Oosterhof with his `interactive surface-based visualization of
  2nd-order representational similarity
  <{filename}/Articles/contest_surfacebased_2ndorder_similarity.rst>`_

Third prize (500 Euro award):
  Lars Marstaller, Jeiran Choupan, and Arend Hintze for their `identification
  of task-related activity using periodic graph properties
  <{filename}/Studies/contest_findforrestnetworks.rst>`_

Congratulations to all awardees! Please make sure to check out each individual
piece of work via their detailed description linked from above. On behalf of
anyone involved, I would also like to thank the jury members for their time and
effort, as well as the Center for Behavioral Brain Sciences Magdeburg for
sponsoring the awards.

Postscript
==========

We have learned a lot while running this contest. Continuing the spirit of our
previous post `on the impact of announcement strategies
<{filename}/Articles/announcement_impact.rst>`_, we will summarize our
experience, the surprises, and the disappointments in a separate article |---|
a few days from now.
