:summary: Final setup for simultaneous fMRI and eye-tracking
:slug: phase2_recording_started


It is done. After quite a few months, numerous pilot scanns, failed attempts,
reconsiderations and some despair: we settled on a final acquisition setup for
the phase 2 recordings of the project -- full-brain fMRI at 3-Tesla (Philips
Achieva 3T dStream, 32ch) with simultaneous eye-gaze tracking at 1000 Hz (SR
Research Eyelink 1000), as well as cardiac and respiratory trace measurements.

In the end, we had to built a custom wooden frame to be able to mount the
camera above the projection screen while getting enough light from the
infra-red spotlight through the space between the rear projection screen and
the scanner tunnel. We also learned that mirrors for consumer rear-projection
TVs are an excellent 50 EUR alternative to "professional" ~600 EUR
front-reflective IR mirrors.

But I think the investment was worth it. With our setup, we can now do
simultaneous eye-tracking with a fairly good quality that is independent of
the stimulus lightness and dynamics. With a good subject it possible to get
data with a spatial uncertainty of 0.3 visual degrees and virtually no drift
over a 15 min recording session. Our only remaining problem are beautifully
long eyelashes...

I am also pleased that we were able to increase the number of cables, gender
changers, and signal converters in the acquisition setup dramatically. This
leaves no doubt that real science is in progress. See for yourselves:

We have now started recording data for the audio-visual "Forrest Gump" from the
participants that had already volunteered for the recordings of the
audio-movie in the 7-Tesla scanner. Fingers crossed ...
