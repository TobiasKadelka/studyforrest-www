:summary: Empirical data on the effect of different ways to announce a project
:slug: announcement_impact

If you want to let the world know about a project of yours, it is clearly not
sufficient to put up a web page and wait for people (and Google) to discover
it. However, when it comes to announcements it wasn't too obvious to me which
strategies would be most effective. Is it worth to spend time on a press
release, or is a post to a focused mailing list as potent? How do traditional
journal releases compare to social media coverage when it comes to
special-interest projects like this one.

As there can only be one initial announcement, the following data needs to be
taken with a grain of salt. However, I made an attempt to spread announcements
made through different channels over time in order to get at least some idea
of what is most effective.

Three weeks of announcements
============================

Here is the plot that summarizes the effect of various announcements made over
the first three weeks. Each significant event is marked on the time axis, and
I'll make a few notes about each of them in the following.

    Daily number of visitor sessions on the studyforrest.org website

    Visitor sessions were measured through Google analytics. A single session
    comprises all consecutive page requests by a single user, regardless of
    the actual number of pages visited. These data do not include users
    that block Google analytics in their browser. The arrows indicate
    significant announcement events.

The launch
==========

On May 27, Nature publishing group launched their new open-access journal
`Scientific Data`_ with our data descriptor in its inaugural issue. This meant
there were only two-clicks or less from nature.com to the article that
contained the link to studyforrest.org. What sounds nice so far, turned out to
be more or less irrelevant regarding the observed website traffic. Until today
only 1.4% of all visitors are coming from any page hosted by nature.com. And
that is despite the fact that our article is the most accessed one in that
issue.  I suspect that a link to the web page in the abstract would have been
more effective.

On the day of the launch, we also issued a press release in English and German.
This press release was managed by the public relations office of the German
Bernstein Network (BCOS_), who coordinated with all involved institutions. A
BIG thanks to them for making this happen! Unlike the link from nature.com this
was a big success: On the day after the release, the biggest European tech news
site `picked it up
<http://www.heise.de/ix/meldung/Open-Science-Forschungsdaten-frei-zugaenglich-2210869.html>`_
(in German).  Until today, this post is the origin of almost 20% of the website
traffic.

Focused channels
================

Next up were announcements to more focused news channels that I consume myself.
First, the global computational neuroscience mailing list comp-neuro_ on June
2, and soon afterwards, on June 4, the `FSL mailing list`_. The original plan
was to see how much traffic these mailing lists would generate, but we fell
victim to a fortunate "accident": `@neuroskeptic`_ tweeted about the real-life
cognition contest on Twitter. Although, it is not possible to tell what the
effect of the mailing posts alone would have been, the combined traffic is very
similar to the one from the more conventional media outlets. All data taken
together, social media (incl. Twitter) is the origin of about 17% of all
traffic to studyforrest.org.

Conference activity
===================

A few days later, I presented dataset and contest at the `OHBM hackathon`_,
and, subsequently with a poster, at the `OHBM conference`_ itself. While a
hackathon is probably the optimal environment for engaging people, a conference
poster is often similar to random sampling of people with tangential interest
strolling through the poster hall. On the other end of the attention spectrum
is a conference keynote. We were extremely lucky that `Jim Haxby`_ gave a talk
on "A common high-dimensional linear model of representational spaces in human
cortex" that was closely connected to natural stimulation paradigms in
neuroimaging research, and that he included the contest announcement as the
last slide in his talk (Thanks!).

Despite a clear increase in website traffic it wasn't even half of the
magnitude of the previous announcements. However, people attending OHBM and
seeing the poster or the keynote are probably easiest to get interested
in the contest, and may turn out to be the most frequent participants.

Catch-all post
==============

The last announcement targeted the `SPM mailing list`_. This is one of the
longest running and most read communication channels for neuroimaging research. However,
the response to the announcement on Jun 16 yielded a traffic increase that was
significantly less than the one in response of the post to `comp-neuro`_ --
despite identical wording of the post.  I suspect the reason for that is
saturation. At this point, we had probably reached most interested people in
neuroimaging research. Google analytics counted about 1800 unique visitors at
that point.

Conclusion
==========

Based on these observations, I believe that you can get your word out to many
people using mailing lists and social media alone. However, I saw no evidence
that you can reach anyone outside your own bubble without conventional, more
general purpose media channels.
