    <p class="lead">Understand how the brain works, in real life.</p>

    <p>In order to fully understand how the brain works, it is essential to
    study the complex inter-play of cognitive processes that are characteristic
    when interacting with a rich natural environment. Going beyond the
    localization of individual aspects of brain function is pivotal as
    there are clear limits to what we can learn about the function of the brain
    as whole via restricting investigation to specialized cognitive sub-systems
    in feature deprived laboratory settings.</p>

    <p>The increasing number of publications focused on multivariate and
    data-driven analysis of brain network dynamics is a clear indication that
    neuroimaging research embraces this challenge, both on a conceptual and
    methodological level.</p>

    <p>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data is by
    far the most commonly used brain imaging paradigm in this emerging domain.
    It can be argued that this is due to the fact that it can be easily
    obtained at relatively low cost, and, even more importantly, it is more
    frequently shared (e.g. <a href="http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/"
    target="_blank">1000 FCP</a>) than any other brain imaging data.</p>

    <p>However, R-fMRI data imposes strict constraints on the kinds of analyses
    it can be used for. For example, it is not meaningful to directly study the
    change in brain activity patterns through time across a group of
    participants, as there is no rich (time-locked) sensory stimulation at the
    time of data acquisition.</p>

    <p>Quasi-naturalistic stimulation, for example by watching a movie,
    represents an alternative paradigm that is compatible with most methods
    developed for R-fMRI, but additionally enables studies of the dynamics of
    neural processes across multiple individuals in real life contexts. In
    their recent review, <a
    href="http://hlab.princeton.edu/Papers/hasson_honey_neuroimage_2012.pdf">Hasson
    and Honey (2012)</a> identified this approach as an emerging trend that is
    likely to play a major role in brain imaging research over the next decade.</p>

    <p>There are two main challenges that will determine the success of this
    approach in terms of both quality and quantity of scientific output:</p>

    <h3>Availability of real-life cognition data</h3>
    <p class="lead">More well-described data is needed.</p>

    <p>At present, there are very few datasets available to study complex brain
    function in real life contexts. In this project, we aim to gather a large
    dataset comprising of a versatile set of brain imaging techniques and
    stimulation paradigms. All data will be released freely into the public
    domain to facilitate contributions by independent research groups and
    scientists from other disciplines. However, a single dataset and the
    resources of a single imaging center will not be enough to address the need
    for appropriate data.</p>

    <p>The challenge is to provide the scientific community with data in a form
    that facilitates re-use, and integration of results and derived or
    processed data with the original dataset in order to enable incremental
    research for the community at large.</p>

    <h3>Analysis strategies to study complex concurrent neural processes</h3>
    <p class="lead">Reliable, and readily usable analysis techniques are needed.</p>

    <p>Over the past years many new techniques have been developed for
    multivariate, data-driven analysis of brain imaging data, for example
    various brain parcellation procedures. At present it is
    unclear how reliable these tools work in real life contexts. Often there
    are significant technical hurdles that prevent an efficient evaluation of
    these new tools before they get integrated with one of the major data
    analysis suites.  Consequently, it is all-too-common for such new
    methodologies to take years to get adopted by the neuroimaging research
    community.</p>

    <p>The challenge is to reduce this time-to-adoption by facilitating the
    (crowd-sourced) evaluation of new algorithms with public data for
    benchmarks, promotion of scientific results in close proximity to the
    relevant datasets, and integration of algorithm implementations in readily
    usable form, for example via a ready-made computational environment that is
    freely available to anyone.</p>

	<h2>Real-life neural processing contest [unconfirmed]</h2>
    <p class="lead">Kick-start a mass-collaboration to study the brain in its
    natural environment.</p>

    <p>We invite research groups and individuals to participate in a contest to
    master these challenges. Among all submissions that are received
    <strong>until November 1 2014</strong> a jury will determine the best
    contributions in terms of novelty of the approach, scientific rigor, and
    potential impact on future research and application. The best three
    contributions will receive an <strong>award</strong> (3000, 2000, and 1000
    Euro respectively) sponsored by the <a href="http://www.cbbs.eu">Center
    for Behavioral Brain Sciences</a>, Magdeburg, Germany.</p>

    <p>The jury consists of:
    <ul>
      <li>Uri Hasson (Princeton) [unconfirmed]</li>
      <li>James Haxby (Dartmouth College) [unconfirmed]</li>
      <li>Daniel Margulies (MPI Leipzig) [unconfirmed]</li>
      <li>Russ Poldrack (U Texas, Austin) [unconfirmed]</li>
      <li>Jean-Baptiste Poline (Neurospin) [unconfirmed]</li>
      <li>tbn CBBS director (CBBS, Magdeburg) [unconfirmed]</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Participation and evaluation criteria are:
    <ul>
      <li>Each contribution must either <strong>consist of or use data from complex
      quasi-natural stimulation</strong> engaging complex concurrent neural processes,
      such as the dataset provided at <a href="http://www.studyforrest.org">
          studyforrest.org</a>.</li>
      <li>Each contribution must be accompanied by a <strong>demo web-page</strong> that
      summarizes the contribution and references all necessary components
      (related publications, software, data). This page will be hosted on the contest
      website and is the <strong>primary material for the jury evaluation</strong>.</li>
      <li>All results of a contribution must be <strong>fully reproducible</strong>. This should
      be possible by a (series of) scripts or an otherwise automated process
      using unmodified publicly available data as input. Participants are
      invited to provide a complete computational environment (e.g. a
      <a href="http://neuro.debian.net/vm.html" target="_blank">NeuroDebian
      virtual machine</a> to enable anyone to reproduce their findings.
      Only results that could be reproduced independently will be considered
      by the jury (except for data contributions).</li>
      <li>All data contributions or data required to reproduce a
      contribution must be deposited in a community-recognized repository,
      such as <a href="http://www.openfmri.org" target="_blank">
      openfmri.org</a></li>
      <li>All results must be made available in a way that facilitates re-use.
      For example, this should include public availability of unthresholded
      statistic maps (e.g. deposited at <a href="http://neurovault.org"
      target="_blank">neurovault.org</a>.</li>
      <li>Positive independent peer-review of results will be considered by the
      jury. This peer-review can be documented by acceptance of a corresponding
      publication in a peer-reviewed journal, or by public post-publication peer
      review.</li>
    </ul>

    Hasson and Honey, 2012</a> for a review of this emerging field), and/or
    use or provide versatile and unique datasets for this purpose.
    The topic is in no way limited to contributions from brain
    imaging researchers, but explicitly welcomes submission from
    inter-disciplinary teams that broaden the spectrum of tools and strategies
    used in this domain.</p>

    <p>This research topic is open for contributions of methods articles
    (both novel techniques, as well as evaluation of existing techniques
    in the context of complex natural stimulation), review or perspective
