    <p class="lead">Understand how the brain works, in real life.</p>

    <p>In order to fully understand how the brain works, it is essential to
    study the complex inter-play of cognitive processes that are characteristic
    when interacting with a rich natural environment. This next step beyond the
    localization of individual aspects of brain function is unavoidable as
    there are clear limits to what we can learn about the function of the brain
    as whole via restricting investigation to specialized cognitive sub-systems
    in feature deprived laboratory settings.</p>

    <p>The increasing number of publications focused on multivariate and
    data-driven analysis of brain network dynamics is a clear indication that
    neuroimaging research embraces this challenge, both on a conceptual and
    methodological level.</p>

    <p>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data is by
    far the most commonly used brain imaging paradigm in this emerging domain.
    It can be argued that this is due to the fact that it can be easily
    obtained at relatively low cost, and, even more importantly, it is more
    frequently shared (e.g. <a href="http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/"
    target="_blank">1000 FCP</a>) than any other brain imaging data.</p>

    <p>However, R-fMRI data imposes strict constraints on the kinds of analyses
    it can be used for. For example, It is not meaningful to directly study the
    change in brain activity patterns through time across a group of
    participants, and there is no rich sensory stimulation at the time of data
    acquisition.</p>

    <p>Quasi-naturalistic stimulation, for example by watching a movie,
    represents an alternative paradigm that is compatible with most methods
    developed for rFMRI, but additionally enables studies of the dynamics of
    neural processes across multiple individuals in real life contexts. In
    their recent review, <a
    href="http://hlab.princeton.edu/Papers/hasson_honey_neuroimage_2012.pdf">Hasson
    and Honey (2012)</a> identified this approach as an emerging trend that is
    likely to play a major role in brain imaging research over the next decade.</p>

    <p>There are two main challenges that will determine the success of this
    approach in terms of both quality and quantity of scientific output:</p>

    <h3>Availability of real-life cognition data</h3>
    <p class="lead">More well-described data is needed.</p>

    <p>At present, there are very few datasets available to study complex brain
    function in real life contexts. In this project, we aim to gather a large
    dataset comprising of a versatile set of brain imaging techniques and
    stimulation paradigms. All data will be released freely into the public
    domain to facilitate contributions by independent research groups and
    scientists from other disciplines. However, a single dataset and the
    resources of a single imaging center will not be enough to address the need
    for appropriate data.</p>

    <p>The challenge is to provide the scientific community with data in a form
    that facilitates re-use, and integration of results and derived or
    processed data with the original dataset in order to enable incremental
    research for the community at large.</p>

    <h3>Analysis strategies to study complex concurrent neural processes</h3>
    <p class="lead">Reliable, and readily usable analysis techniques are needed.</p>

    <p>Over the past years many new techniques have been developed for
    multivariate, data-driven analysis of brain imaging data, for example
    various clustering procedures for brain parcellation. At present it is
    unclear how reliable these tools work in real life contexts. Often there
    are significant technical hurdles that prevent an efficient evaluation of
    these new tools before they get integrated with one of the major data
    analysis suites.  Consequently, it is all-too-common for such new
    methodologies to take years to be adopted by the neuroimaging research
    community.</p>

    <p>The challenge is to reduce this time-to-adoption by facilitating the
    (crowd-sourced) evaluation of new algorithms with public data for
    benchmarks, promotion of scientific results in close proximity to the
    relevant datasets, and integration of algorithm implementations in readily
    usable form, for example via a ready-made computational environment that is
    freely available to anyone.</p>
