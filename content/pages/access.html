  <h2>Download With DataLad</h2>
  <p>All <em>StudyForrest</em> data are contained as a collection of
     <a href="https://www.datalad.org/">DataLad</a> datasets on
     <a href="https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/studyforrest-data">GitHub</a>.
     DataLad provides fine-grained data access down to the level of
     individual files, and allows for tracking future updates. It is a free
     and open source command line tool, available for all major operating
     systems, and builds up on Git and <a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com">git annex</a>
     to allow sharing, synchronizing, and version controlling collections of
     large files. You can find information on how to install DataLad in the
     <a href="http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/installation.html">DataLad Handbook</a>.

  <h3>Get the dataset</h3>
  <p>The dataset can be <code>cloned</code> by running:</p>
  <pre>datalad clone https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/studyforrest-data</pre>
  <p>Once the dataset is cloned, it is a light-weight directory on your local
     machine. At this point, it contains only small metadata and information
     on the identity of the files in the dataset, but not actual
     <em>content</em> of the (sometimes large) data files.</p>

  <h3>Retrieve dataset content</h3>
  <p>After cloning the dataset, you can retrieve file contents by running:
  <pre>datalad get path/to/directory/or/file</pre>
  <p>This command will trigger a download of the files, directories, or
     subdatasets you have specified.</p>

  <p>This dataset contains other datasets, so called <em>subdatasets</em>.
     If you clone the top-level dataset, subdatasets do not yet contain
     metadata and information on the identity of files, but appear to be
     empty directories. In order to retrieve file availability metadata in
     subdatasets, run:</p>
  <pre>datalad get -n path/to/subdataset</pre>

  <p>Afterwards, you can browse the retrieved metadata to find out about
     subdataset contents, and retrieve individual files with <code>datalad
     get</code>. If you use <code>datalad get path/to/subdataset</code>,
     all contents of the subdataset will be downloaded at once.
