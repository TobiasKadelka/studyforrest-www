    <h2>What is <em>studyforrest</em>?</h2>
    <p>The <strong>human brain</strong> is designed to process vast amounts of
       diverse input that are continuously gathered across the senses. However,
       most experiments study the brain via simplified stimuli that do little to
       resemble the complexity of a <strong>natural environment</strong> &mdash;
       a mismatch that must be addressed if we are to better understand how the
       brain works.</p>
    <p>This project centers around the use of <strong>the movie Forrest
       Gump</strong>, which provides complex sensory input that is both
       reproducible and is also richly laden with real-life-like content and
       contexts.</p>
    <p>Over the last few years, the <em>studyforrest</em> dataset has grown
       significantly and now encompasses many <strong>hours of fMRI
       scans</strong>, structural brain scans, <strong>eye-tracking</strong>
       data, and extensive <strong>annotations</strong> of the movie. Explore
       our <a href="/data.html">Data Page</a> to more closely examine the data
       we have available.</p>

      <h3>Neuroscience Researchers</h3>
      <p>This is a <strong>one-of-a-kind resource</strong> for studying
         high-level cognition in the human brain under complex, natural
         stimulation. However, the versatility of the provided data, for some
         individuals almost ten hours of fMRI data alone, enables studies far
         beyond this main focus. This covers a vast range from studies of
         low-level signal properties and brain structure, over sensory
         integration and attentional processes, to computational modeling of
         representational spaces and brain area interactions. Take a look the
         <a href="/publications.html">List of Publications</a> to get
         inspired.</p>

      <h3>Scientific Developers</h3>
      <p>The <em>studyforrest</em> project provides <strong>ideal reference
         datasets</strong> for brain imaging. It's a comprehensive, modular,
         multi-modal, real-world dataset &mdash; making it an optimal choice
         when benchmarking algorithms or comparing implementations across
         projects.</p>
      <p>Liberally licensed (<a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/">PDDL</a>)
         and hosted across many <a href="/access.html">different services</a>
         (S3, rsync, OpenfMRI, etc) with fine-grained access options, the
         <em>studyforrest</em> dataset is easily accessible and is ready to be
         integrated into your CI infrastructure.</p>

      <h3>Everyone &mdash;&nbsp;and&nbsp;You</h3>
      <p>Not keen on brain research? This project still has something to offer
         to you! For example, our ongoing effort to analyze the
         <strong>structure of the movie "Forrest Gump"</strong> and annotate its
         properties continues to expand the breadth of topics that can be
         explored. Check out the <a href="/data.html">Data Page</a> to see what
         is already in store.</p>
      <p>What we're most interested in, we admit, is that which we cannot
         anticipate. So please, invent applications and <strong>explore ideas
         you have</strong> that we aren't even aware of &mdash; yet... and do
         tell us about them!</p>

    <h2>How Have People Been Using It?</h2>
    <blockquote>[...] anatomical subdivisions of auditory cortex revealed great
      functional diversity and lateralization in intensity discrimination [...]
      naturalistic paradigm [...] improves the ecological validity but also
      alleviate the discrepancies caused by the differences in stimulus types
      and task designs in previous studies. &mdash;

    <blockquote>[...] magnetic resonance advection imaging might have future
      potential to contribute to the modeling of the cerebrovascular system and
      to serve as a biomarker for cerebrovascular disease. &mdash;

    <blockquote>Our study for the first time demonstrates the insular hierarchy
      for interoceptive processing during natural emotional experience. &mdash;

    <blockquote>This also opens the door for the identification of shared and
      individual [brain] responses [...] to assess the degree to which
      functional topography is shared across subjects. We posit that this
      technique can be adapted to examine an array of situations where group
      differences are the key experimental variable. &mdash;
