     Study Forrest is an ever-expanding dataset composed of fMRI scans, EEG
     recordings, eye-tracking data, and extensive annotations overlaying the
     movie *Forrest Gump*. Our aim is high quality, diversity, and
     comprehensiveness — while also maintaining modularity, so you can
     easily and efficiently acquire the subset of data you need. Explore our
     `Data Page <{filename}/pages/resources.rst>`_ to take a closer look at
     exactly what kinds of data we have to offer.

     :h3:`Neuroscience Researchers`

     Rather than study the brain using simplified stimuli, the movie Forrest
     Gump is used to provide a complex sensory input that is reproduceable, yet
     also richly laden with real-life-like content and contexts.

     While a dataset like this is interesting and valuable enough in its own
     right, it is coupled with both eye-tracking data and an ever-expanding set
     of movie annotations. This provides, we believe, a unique oppourtunity to
     delve into and understand the actual contexts delivered by such a complex
     stimulus.

     Provide some Neurosciency Jargon. Too much 3T - 7T to handle with all that
     EEG that's goin' on. Perhaps appended to/after the first paragraph.

     :h3:`Scientific Developers`

     We feel that Study Forrest has the potential to become the reference
     dataset of choice. Its modular nature allows it to be easily adopted by
     many different tools, and its diversity allows it to grow along with tools
     as they improve and evolve |---| even across acquisition methods.

     Benchmarking new algorithms or comparing implementations across projects
     becomes much easier |---| and more meaningful |---| with a real-world
     reference dataset to test against.

     How about integrating a real-world dataset into your CI infrastructure to
     catch regressions, performance and otherwise, before they're released?
     Now that's pure excellence.

     :h3:`Everyone —&nbsp;and&nbsp;You`

     We are interested in everything that we don't know we even should be asking
     for. Humanity's interests are limitless and stretch for beyond the bounds
     of Neuroscience and scientific tooling. We hope and believe that the Study
     Forrest dataset has real value in fields beyond our own. And we are excited
     to see the connections and results that a diversity of approaches can
     create with this dataset collection.
