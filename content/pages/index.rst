     The **human brain** is designed to process vast amounts of diverse input
     that are continuously gathered across the senses. However, most
     experiments study the brain via simplified stimuli that do little to
     resemble the complexity of a **natural environment** |---| a mismatch that
     must be addressed if we are to better understand how the brain works.

     This project centers around the use of **the movie Forrest Gump**,
     which provides complex sensory input that is both reproducible and is also
     richly laden with real-life-like content and contexts.

     Over the last few years, the *studyforrest* dataset has grown
     significantly and now encompasses many **hours of fMRI scans**, structural
     brain scans, **eye-tracking** data, and extensive **annotations** of the
     movie.  Explore our `Data Page <{filename}/pages/resources.rst>`_ to more
     closely examine the data we have available.

     This is a **one-of-a-kind resource** for studying high-level cognition in
     the human brain under complex, natural stimulation. However, the
     versatility of the provided data, for some individuals almost ten hours of
     fMRI data alone, enables studies far beyond this main focus. This covers a
     vast range from studies of low-level signal properties and brain
     structure, over sensory integration and attentional processes, to
     computational modeling of representational spaces and brain area
     interactions. Take a look the `Publications Page
     <{filename}/pages/publications.rst>`_ to get inspired.

     :h3:`Scientific Developers`

     The *studyforrest* project provides **ideal reference datasets** for brain
     imaging. It's a comprehensive, modular, multi-modal, real-world dataset
     |---| making it an optimal choice when benchmarking algorithms or comparing
     implementations across projects.

     Liberally licensed (`PDDL
     <http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/>`_) and hosted across many
     `different services <{filename}/pages/access.rst>`_ (S3, rsync, OpenfMRI,
     etc) with fine-grained access options, the *studyforrest* dataset is
     easily accessible and is ready to be integrated into your CI
     infrastructure.

     :h3:`Everyone â€”&nbsp;and&nbsp;You`

     Not keen on brain research? This project still has something to offer to
     you! For example, our ongoing effort to analyze the **structure of the
     movie "Forrest Gump"** and annotate its properties continues to expand the
     breadth of topics that can be explored. Check out the `Data Page
     <{filename}/pages/resources.rst>`_ to see what is already in store.

     What we're most interested in, we admit, is that which we cannot
     anticipate. So please, invent applications and **explore ideas you have**
     that we aren't even aware of |---| yet.... and do tell us about them!

       "This also opens the door for the identification of shared and
       individual [brain] responses [...] to assess the degree to which
       functional topography is shared across subjects. We posit that this
       technique can be adapted to examine an array of situations where group
       differences are the key experimental variable."
