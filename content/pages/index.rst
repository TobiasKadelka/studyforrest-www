     The human brain is designed to process vast amounts of diverse input that
     are continuously gathered across the senses. However, most experiments
     study the brain via simplified stimuli that do little to resemble the
     complexity of a natural environment |---| a mismatch that must be addressed
     if we are to better understand how the brain works.

     This project centers around the use of the movie *Forrest Gump*,
     which provides complex sensory input that is both reproducible and is also
     richly laden with real-life-like content and contexts.

     Over the last few years, the Study Forrest dataset has grown significantly,
     and it now encompasses fMRI scans, EEG recordings, eye-tracking data, and
     extensive annotations overlaying the movie. Explore our `Data Page
     <{filename}/pages/resources.rst>`_ to more closely examine the data we have
     available.

     Provide some Neurosciency Jargon. Too much 3T and 7T to handle with all
     the EEG that's goin' on up in their eyeballs.

     We feel that Study Forrest has the potential to become *the* reference
     dataset in Neuroscience. It's a comprehensive, modular, multi-modal,
     real-world dataset, making it an ideal choice when benchmarking
     algorithms or comparing implementations across projects.

     Liberally licensed (`PDDL
     <http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/>`_) and hosted across many
     `different services <{filename}/pages/access.rst>`_ (S3, rsync, OpenfMRI,
     etc), the Study Forrest dataset is easily accessible and is ready to be
     integrated into your CI infrastructure.

     :h3:`Everyone â€”&nbsp;and&nbsp;You`

     Cinematographers,

     What we're most interested in, we admit, is that which we cannot
     anticipate.

     We admit, there's a limit to our imaginations, and that's a good thing.
     Whether you're working in Hollywood and you're interested in eye-tracking
     data through a feature-length film,

     Most of all, we're interesting in what applications and ideas you have
     that we aren't even aware of |---| yet.
