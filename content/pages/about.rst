     This project is an open invitation to anyone and everyone to participate in
     a decentralized effort to explore the opportunities of open science in
     neuroimaging. We aim to document how much (scientific) value can be
     generated from a data release |---| from the publication of scientific
     findings derived from this dataset, algorithms and methods evaluated on
     this dataset, and/or extensions of this dataset by acquisition and
     incorporation of new data.

     For questions and inquiries, please email us at `info@studyforrest.org
     <mailto:info@studyforrest.org?subject=studyforrest.org>`_.

     This website is maintained by the `Psychoinformatics Lab
     <http://www.ipsy.ovgu.de/ipsy/en/psychoinformatics.html>`_ at the
     Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany.

     :h2:`Acknowledgements`

     This project has been made possible by funds and support of various grants
     and institutions.

     A grant from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)
     funded the initial data acquisition as part of the US-German collaboration
     in computational neuroscience (CRCNS) project: *Development of general
     high-dimensional models of neuronal representation spaces* (`Haxby
     <http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/>`_ / `Ramagde
     <http://www.ee.princeton.edu/ramadge/doku.php>`_ / `Hanke
     <http://www.psychoinformatics.de/>`_), co-funded by the BMBF and the US
     National Science Foundation (BMBF 01GQ1112; NSF 1129855).

     Moreover, development of data sharing technology used for dissemination and
     management of this dataset is supported by another US-German collaboration
     grant awarded to `Halchenko
     <http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/ppl/yarik.html>`_ and Hanke: *DataLad:
     Converging catalogues, warehouses, and deployment logistics into a
     federated 'data distribution'*, also co-funded by BMBF (01GQ1411) and NSF
     (1129855).

     The German federal state of Saxony-Anhalt, Project: `Center for Behavioral
     Brain Sciences`_ provided data acquisition hardware and personnel.

     The Otto-von-Guericke-University_, Magdeburg, Germany.

     The `Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology`_ and the `Combinatorial
     NeuroImaging Core Facility`_ in Magdeburg, Germany provided MR imaging
     expertise and access to its data acquisition instruments.
